NB: the release for msxdev 14 is in the file URIDIUM48.ROM

The rom named URDIUM3c.rom has to be considered out of contest.
It is intended to be used on real HW and CRT monitors.

On emulators, set perfect vsync between msx and the monitor refresh
On bluemsx the best results are reached with the option "blend cnsecutive frames"
